# HashX - High-Performance 256-bit Hashing Algorithm  

HashX is an ultra-fast, efficient, and **secure 256-bit hashing algorithm** designed for **data integrity verification, indexing, checksums, and non-cryptographic applications**.  

Built with **multi-threading, optimized bitwise operations, and an advanced mixing function**, HashX delivers exceptional **speed, collision resistance, and scalability**.  

## 🚀 Features & Enhancements  

✅ **High-Speed Processing** – Optimized bitwise operations and low-level transformations.  
✅ **Multi-Threaded Execution** – Parallel chunk processing for increased speed.  
✅ **256-bit Strong Hash Output** – Reduces collisions while maintaining efficiency.  
✅ **Advanced Mixing Function** – Inspired by MurmurHash3 for better diffusion.  
✅ **Bitwise Rotation Optimization** – Faster and more secure state transformations.  
✅ **Lightweight & Scalable** – Low memory usage, works on large data sets.  
✅ **Strong Avalanche Effect** – Small input changes drastically modify the hash.  
✅ **Cross-Platform & Extensible** – Works seamlessly in Python, with future support planned for C/Rust.  

## 📥 Installation  

Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProgrammerKR/HashX.git
```
Navigate to the directory:  
```bash
cd HashX
```

## 🛠️ Usage  

### **Python Example**  
```python
from hashx import HashX

hasher = HashX()
print(hasher.hash("Hello, World!"))  # Example usage
```

## ⚙️ How It Works  

1. **Initialization** – Hash state consists of **4 unique parts**, seeded for strong uniqueness.  
2. **Chunk Processing** – Data is split into **64-bit blocks**, processed in **parallel threads**.  
3. **Bitwise Mixing & Rotation** – Advanced scrambling ensures strong randomness.  
4. **Finalization Rounds** – Enhanced diffusion eliminates weak patterns.  
5. **Output Generation** – 256-bit hexadecimal hash is returned.  

## 🔬 Benchmarking (Coming Soon)  

HashX is being tested against **SHA-256, BLAKE3, xxHash, and MurmurHash3** for speed and efficiency.  

## 🛠️ Future Plans  

- **C and Rust Implementation** for ultra-fast performance.  
- **GPU Acceleration** using CUDA/OpenCL.  
- **Cryptographic Security Mode** for password hashing.
