# HashX - High-Performance Hashing Algorithm  

HashX is a fast, lightweight, and efficient **256-bit hashing algorithm** designed for **data integrity verification, checksums, and non-cryptographic applications**.  

## Features  
✅ **High Speed** - Optimized for performance with bitwise operations.  
✅ **256-bit Output** - Ensures strong uniqueness for input data.  
✅ **Avalanche Effect** - Small input changes drastically alter the output.  
✅ **Lightweight** - Uses minimal computational resources.  
✅ **Good Collision Resistance** - Ideal for hash tables, indexing, and data verification.  

## Installation  
Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/HashX.git
```
Then, navigate to the directory:  
```bash
cd HashX
```

## Usage  
### **Python Example**  
```python
from hashx import HashX

hasher = HashX()
print(hasher.hash("Hello, World!"))  # Example usage
```

## How It Works  
1. **Initialization:**  
   - The hash state consists of **4 parts**, initialized using a **seed** value.  
2. **Processing Input Data:**  
   - The input is split into **64-bit chunks**.  
   - Each chunk is processed using **mixing, bitwise rotation, and XOR operations**.  
3. **Finalization:**  
   - A final mixing step ensures **uniformity**.  
   - The state is converted into a **256-bit hexadecimal hash**.  

## Example Output  
```
a1b2c3d4e5f67890abcd1234ef56789012345678abcdef9876543210fedcba98
```
